<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>N.B. </B>The instructions below are from a Windows
XP machine with SP2 and no extra software. This should work on all
versions of Windows, but you may find options are on slightly
different screens.</P>
Start off with just your main computer
running, all others turned off.<BR>
<BR>
Open your Network Connection Status
window (from Control Panel, or from right clicking on the icon in
your status bar)<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7376.jpg" NAME="Graphic1" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=306 HEIGHT=375 BORDER=0>
<BR>
Go to the Support tab:<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7377.jpg" NAME="Graphic2" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=306 HEIGHT=375 BORDER=0>
<BR>
And then go to Details...<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7378.jpg" NAME="Graphic3" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=295 BORDER=0>
<BR>
Write down the following, with the
details from your computer. You may only have one DNS server, that is
fine, just note down what you have.<BR>
IP Address: 192.168.1.2<BR>
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<BR>
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.254<BR>
DHCP Server: 192.168.1.254<BR>
DNS Servers: 206.191.0.140,
206.191.0.210<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Close that window, go back to the
General tab, select Properties<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7379.jpg" NAME="Graphic4" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=306 HEIGHT=375 BORDER=0>
<BR>
Highlight Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
and select Properties here. Change it to Use the following IP address
and Use the following DNS server addresses and fill them in with the
information from above. If you only have one DNS server above, just
leave the Alternate DNS server blank, don't try to make something up.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a737a.jpg" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=379 BORDER=0>
<BR>
Now select OK and Close respectively to
get out of all of the windows until you are back at your desktop.<BR>
<BR>
Go to your router configuration window
and turn off the DHCP server. This is very router specific so I
haven't shown it here.<BR>
<BR>
Download the newest version of <A HREF="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/philippe.jounin/tftpd32.html#Versions">tftpd32</A>,
create a directory on your hard drive and put the contents of the zip
file in that directory:<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a737b.jpg" NAME="Graphic6" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=373 BORDER=0>
<BR>
Startup tftpd32, note that Windows or
any firewall program you have may pop up an alert about the ports
that tftpd32 wants to listen on.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a737c.jpg" NAME="Graphic7" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=362 HEIGHT=260 BORDER=0>
<BR>
Select Unblock / Allow or similar
<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a737d.jpg" NAME="Graphic8" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=266 BORDER=0><BR>
Select Settings<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a737e.jpg" NAME="Graphic9" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=307 HEIGHT=382 BORDER=0><BR>
Only have the TFTP Server and DHCP
Server enabled, leave the TFTP Security as Standard, turn on PXE
Compatibility and Allow '\' As virtual root. Select OK and close and
restart tftpd32 to get the changes to take effect.<BR>
<BR>
Go to the DHCP server tab on the main window<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a737f.jpg" NAME="Graphic10" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=266 BORDER=0><BR>
IP Pool starting address should be the
IP address of your main box + 10<BR>
Size of pool should be number of
diskless folders plus a few. Make sure that this plus the last number
of the IP pool starting address is less than 254.<BR>
Boot File should be pxelinux.0 (number
0, not capital letter O)<BR>
WINS/DNS Server should be your first
DNS server<BR>
Default router is the default gateway<BR>
Mask is the subnet mask.<BR>
Leave the rest blank and press Save.<BR>
<BR>
Download the network diskless zip file
from <A HREF="diskless.zip">HERE</A> (12MB) and extract the contents to the same directory that is
holding tftpd32.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7380.jpg" NAME="Graphic11" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=558 HEIGHT=330 BORDER=0>
<BR>
In the pxelinux.cfg directory there is
a file called default, open this with WordPad (use WordPad and not NotePad because the file is in Unix format) and change the USER and
TEAM if necessary. You may also want to change BIG to no if you don't
want to work on big WUs.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7381.jpg" NAME="Graphic12" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=213 BORDER=0>
<BR>
<BR>
Boot your diskless workstations, you
should see them startup in the log shown under the TFTP Server tab in
tftpd32. This can help in determining the IP addresses of them for
you to point a web browser at to monitor them. Alternatively, the machine exports the ramdisk via Windows Networking and the folding files are in <TT>\\$Machine\C\etc\folding\$Instance</TT>.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/430a7382.jpg" NAME="Graphic13" ALT="&lt;IMG&gt;" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=479 HEIGHT=309 BORDER=0>
<BR>
After
a couple of hours, you will see backup files appear in the same
directory. These are of the format:
<TT>backup.$IP.A.$Instance<BR>backup.$IP.B.$Instance<BR>latest.$IP.$Instance<BR></TT>
where <TT>$IP</TT> is the IP address and <TT>$Instance</TT> is the instance being backed up.
