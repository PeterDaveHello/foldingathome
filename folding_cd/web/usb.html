<title>Folding USB Stick</title>
</head>
<body>
Download the <A HREF="usb.zip">files</A>(12MB) and unzip them on to a blank memory stick.<BR>
Download syslinux as appropriate for your OS:
<UL>
<LI>Windows NT, 2000, XP, 2003 <A HREF="syslinux.exe">here</A>
<LI>Windows 95, 98, ME <A HREF="syslinux.com">here</A>
<LI>Linux <A HREF="syslinux">here</A>
</UL>
From a command prompt run &quot;syslinux &lt;device&gt;&quot; where &lt;device&gt; is the device or drive letter of the USB stick, e.g. &quot;syslinux X:&quot; for Windows, &quot;./syslinux /dev/sda1&quot; for Linux (should not be mounted). If it complains about unable to lock the device for exclusive access, ignore the warning.<BR><BR>
Edit the file isolinux.sys and change the USER and TEAM options to get it to fold for you rather than me. You may also want to change BIG=yes to BIG=no to avoid large WU depending on your network.<BR>
<BR>Boot your machine from the USB stick. Note that not all machines like booting from USB sticks, even if the option is there in the BIOS.<BR><BR>
<B>N.B.</B> Please comply with the F@H terms of service and only use this on
computers you own / have permission. Law enforcement agencies have been
involved in previous unauthorised use of computers for folding!<BR><BR>
<B>Notes</B>
<UL>
<LI>Only shut off or reboot the machine when it is not accessing the stick. All sticks I have seen have flashing lights on them, fast flash is being accessed, slow flash is not. If you do pull out the stick / power off / reboot whilst the stick is being accessed, you will need to run scandisk/chkdsk/fsck or whatever to fix the filesystem.
<LI>It will run an instance of folding per processor that it finds (logical processor, so 2 on hyperthreading and dual-core CPUs) or if there are multiple x86_64 processors it will run an SMP client per 4 processors.<BR>
<LI>Instances of folding are stored in the directories 1, 2 etc. that it creates on the USB stick.
<LI>You only need motherboard, processor (with heatsink/fan!), memory and a supported network connection (just about any PCI or onboard Ethernet card supported by Linux). Keyboard is ignored, if you do have a video card and monitor it will show progress of the first folding instance on the screen.<BR>
<LI>To monitor the machine, just point your web browser at it.<BR>
<LI>If you have a TFTP server and your DHCP server advertises it, the work will get backed up at the specified interval into the following 3 files<BR><TT>backup.$IP.A.$Instance<BR>backup.$IP.B.$Instance<BR>latest.$IP.$Instance<BR></TT>where <TT>$IP</TT> is the IP address and <TT>$Instance</TT> is the instance being backed up. You typically need to initially create empty versions of these files on your TFTP server and make them writable by all for this to work. It will also backup and restore from up to 2 USB drives if present.<BR>
<LI>If you select the install option, if it finds any USB drives at boot, it will write a copy to the USB drive and also write a Master Boot Record making the USB drive bootable.<BR>
<LI>If you have any further questions, hit the "TR Distributed Computing Effort" forum at <a href=http://www.techreport.com>The Tech Report</a> and ask "notfred".
