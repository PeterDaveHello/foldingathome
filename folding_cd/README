The Folding CD can only be built on a 64bit (x86_64) system. It will build an
image that will work for both 64bit(x86_64) and 32bit(i686) systems.

The Diskless Folding zip file (for PXE boot) is derived from The Folding CD and is also built. It appears as diskless.zip in the base directory.

The Folding USB stick zip file (for USB boot) is derived from The Folding CD and
is also built. It appears as usb.zip in the base directory.

The build system uses a standard Makefile. Interesting targets are:
all:         folding_cd.iso diskless.zip usb.zip
install_net: Installs a PXE boot in to /var/lib/tftpboot
install_web: Publishes everything to /var/www/reilly/folding including scripts
             and necessary files to /usr/lib/cgi-bin

The Folding CD makes use of the following Open Source Software
licensed under the GPLv2:
Linux Kernel
Syslinux
Busybox
GlibC

In order to build, you will need an up to date tool chain, including the
following specialised tools (Debian/Ubuntu package names):
nasm
gawk
zip
mkisofs

In addition a set of 32 bit C libraries is cross compiled to support the
folding client and other binaries. This requires the additional tools:
ia32-libs
libc6-dev-i386
lib32gcc1
gcc-multilib (Ubuntu 7.10, not required on Ubuntu 7.04)

To completely build and install requires the building of a Windows version of
syslinux, this requires the mingw compiler available through the following
package:
mingw32

This software downloads the folding client and cores from Stanford to comply
with the Folding@Home license.
