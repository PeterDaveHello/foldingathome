<body>
Download the <A HREF="folding.zip">files</A>(16MB) and unzip them. A new directory "folding" will be created with two files:
<UL>
<LI>folding.vmx - VMWare control file
<LI>folding.vmdk - VMWare Virtual Disk Image file
</UL>
To run in a <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/" target="_blank">VMware Server</a> virtual machine, just point VMware at the folding.vmx file.<BR>
To run under KVM, first setup your network to run as bridged networking, then "sudo kvm -net nic -net tap -m 1024 -smp 2 folding.vmdk" and change the memory and SMP option to however many you need.<BR>
The system will start up and run with default settings, point a web browser at the specified IP address and hit the "Reconfigure this host and any USB drives." link to reconfigure it and then hit the "Remote reboot: enabled" link to get it to pick up the new configuration.<BR>
<B>N.B.</B> Please comply with the F@H terms of service and only use this on
computers you own / have permission. Law enforcement agencies have been
involved in previous unauthorised use of computers for folding!<BR><BR>
<B>Notes</B>
<UL>
<LI>It will run an instance of folding per processor that it finds (logical processor, so 2 on hyperthreading and dual-core CPUs) or if there are multiple x86_64 processors it will run an SMP client per 4 processors.<BR>
<LI>Instances of folding are stored in the directories 1, 2 etc. that it creates on the USB stick.
<LI>You only need motherboard, processor (with heatsink/fan!), memory and a supported network connection (just about any PCI or onboard Ethernet card supported by Linux). Keyboard is ignored, if you do have a video card and monitor it will show progress of the first folding instance on the screen.<BR>
<LI>To monitor the machine, just point your web browser at it.<BR>
<LI>If you have a TFTP server and your DHCP server advertises it, the work will get backed up at the specified interval into the following 3 files<BR><TT>backup.$IP.A.$Instance<BR>backup.$IP.B.$Instance<BR>latest.$IP.$Instance<BR></TT>where <TT>$IP</TT> is the IP address and <TT>$Instance</TT> is the instance being backed up. You typically need to initially create empty versions of these files on your TFTP server and make them writable by all for this to work. It will also backup and restore from up to 2 USB drives if present.<BR>
